# Computer Vision RPS

# Milestone 2

In this milestone, the computer vision system that detects wether the user is showing Rock, Paper or Scissors to the laptop camera.
This is done by going to "Teachable Machine", a website that provides computer vision models. Here, we take several pictures showing Rock, Paper or Scissors, or nothing, to stablish the 4 scenarios that could happen.

The model for this exercise, shows the probability of the user showing "Rock", "Paper", "Scissors", or nothing to the camera. Therefore, everytime that the user plays the game, the model will try to recognise the hand that the user is playing, and display the probability of the four options mentioned before.
